NOTES:
  A key can NEVER come back as itself
  Energy Pathing:
    Battery -> Switch -> Plugboard -> Rotors -> Reflector -> Rotors -> Plugboard -> Switch -> Lightbulb -> Battery
  Rotor Spins:
    Fast Rotor (Right) Always spins on every button press
    Medium Rotor (Middle) Spins once every 26 fast rotor rotations
    Slow Rotor (Left) Spins once every 26 medium rotor rotations or 26*26 fast rotor rotations
  Configurations:
    Rotors:
      Order of the Rotors (Machine comes with 5, they can be placed in any order)
      Position of the Rotors (26 positions for each)
      Positions of the notches (26 positions for the first two rotors)
    Plugboard:
      Any two letters can be swapped into another
      Usually 7-10 plugs used but I will consider 0-13


  Rotor Orders = 5 P 3 = 60
  Rotor Positions = 26^3
  Notch Positions = 26^2
  Rotors total Possibilities = 712,882,560
